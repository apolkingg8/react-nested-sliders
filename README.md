# React nested sliders 
(Phase challenge #2)

## Requirements
- [ ] Should have Fold/Unfold when click on the right-rectangle at the left side of the track name
- [ ] Should be able to drag the transition bar, left transition handler and right transition handler to change delay and duration.
- [ ] When dragging the transition bar, it should change delay only.
- [ ] When dragging the left transition handler, it should change delay and duration.
- [ ] When dragging the right transition handler, it should change duration only.
- [ ] When changing delay and duration, you should also update other tracks which are related to the selected one.
- [ ] If transition bars are too long, you need to have scroll for it. But the track name panel should be fixed.
- [ ] When a track is selected/hovered, we should highlight both `Track Name` block and `Transition Bar` block. (The whole row)
